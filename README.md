# McDonald's Database Project 2023
Welcome to our Database Project for 2023, focusing on creating a user-friendly database for McDonald's using MySQL. This project simplifies information storage and retrieval based on McDonald's business model.

### Overview:
We've designed a database using MySQL to cater to McDonald's needs. Our aim is to make data analysis easier through use of SELECT queries.

### Components:
**Database Script:** The "PJ2-Sec2Gr8DB (1).sql" file is the core of our project. It contains the essentials for our McDonald's database.

**Documentation:** Check out "PJ2-Sec2Gr8DB (1).pdf" for an overview of the ERD model, relational structure, and data definitions. It's a handy guide to understanding our database setup.
